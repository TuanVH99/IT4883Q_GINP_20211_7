## The project is using
  - NodeJS + MySQL - by TuanVH175995 and Tkank2306
  - ReactJS - By TIENND

## Devide app into 3 part
# Back-end: NodeJs - ExpressJs
- throw the service / endpoint / apis / ... for the front-end
# front-end:ReactJs
- the face of the app :D  fetch the api then show it
# database: MySQL
- I had some difficulties in choosing which db may fit well this app, mongodb, firebase or rsql. Nah, too tired so i chose MySQL,though it is not the most suitable but i hope the app can run well
